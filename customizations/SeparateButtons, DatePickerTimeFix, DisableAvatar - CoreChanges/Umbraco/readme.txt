these changes are made from to the umbraco core
The following has been done:
1. Expose all buttons on content editor (see sc1.png) instead of dropdown
2. Add Ctrl+S in Macroscripts (need to enable macroscripts)
3. Disable avatar. use umbraco logo only
4. Instead of using system time for date pickers, use 0:00:00
